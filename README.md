## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with building out the HTML elements first and then start manipulating the document with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am learning to get better with positioning elements with CSS. After understanding the design of the project with fonts and colors. Positioning seems to be the most difficult but I am growing with the concepts.

### Continued development

I used flexbox for this project and I will continue to expand on flexbox as well as taking a deeper dive into CSS grid before incorporating Bootstrap in the projects
